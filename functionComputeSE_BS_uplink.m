%INPUT:
%Hhat              = Matrix with dimension M*nbrBSs x nbrOfRealizations x K
%                    where (:,n,k) is the estimated collective channel from
%                    all BSs to UE k at channel realization n.
%R                 = Matrix with dimension M x M x nbrBSs x K where
%                    (:,:,l,k) is the spatial correlation matrix between BS
%                    l and UE k in setup n, normalized by the noise power
%B                 = Matrix with dimension M x M x nbrBSs x K where
%                    (:,:,l,k) is the spatial correlation matrix of the
%                    estimate between BS l and UE k in setup n, normalized
%                    by the noise power
%BSassignment      = Matrix with dimension K x 1 containing the
%                    index of the BS that serves a particular UE
%tau_c             = Length of the coherence block
%tau_p             = Length of pilot sequences and number of UEs per cell
%nbrOfRealizations = Number of channel realizations
%M                 = Number of antennas per BS

%OUTPUT:
%SE_MR    = K x 1 matrix where the k:th element is the uplink SE of UE k
%           achieved with MR combining 
%SE_RZF   = Same as SE_MR but with RZF combining
%SE_MMMSE = Same as SE_MR but with M-MMSE combining
